this mod seems like actually a major headache instead of being simple. it also kinda pisses me off that I had this idea independently after watching a tiktok
and when i go to check to see if someone made not only had someone made it but the person is fucking aedenthorn of all people. like bro, its not a mod update this time
its an "original" (i use that generously) idea for once smfh. anyway, i think this can all be made simpler as there are like 4 functions that are long as hell
for probably little to no reason. only major issues i see is probably mod conflicts. but thats about it.
